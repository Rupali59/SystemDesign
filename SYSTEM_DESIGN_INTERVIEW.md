### Algorithms 

* [ ] Bloom filter
A Bloom filter is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.
  * [ ] [Build a Web Crawler](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2016/06/29/build-web-crawler/)

* [ ] Frugal Streaming
Frugal Streaming uses only one unit of memory per group to compute a quantile for each group
  * [ ] [Find the nth percentile of the data stream](https://research.neustar.biz/2013/09/16/sketch-of-the-day-frugal-streaming/)

* [ ] Geohash / S2 Geometry
Geohash can used by 1) dating apps to find romantic matches within a particular cell, and to create chat apps.2) Find nearby locations, and identify places of interest, restaurants, shops and accommodation establishments in an area. 3) Geohashers go on global expeditions to meet people and explore new places.

* [ ] HyperLogLog
HyperLogLog is an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset.

* [ ] Operational transformation
Operational transformation (OT) is a technology for supporting a range of collaboration functionalities in advanced collaborative software systems.

* [ ] Quadtree / Rtree  * [ ] [Spatial Indexing with Quadtrees](https://medium.com/@waleoyediran/spatial-indexing-with-quadtrees-b998ae49336)
- Find nearby interest points

* [ ] Ray casting
Ray casting is the most basic of many computer graphics rendering algorithms that use the geometric algorithm of ray tracing. Given a point with longitude and latitude, return the Country of the point.
  * [ ] [Ray Casting Algorithm](http://philliplemons.com/posts/ray-casting-algorithm)

* [ ] Reverse index
Reverse Index: a reverse index is an index of keywords which stores records of documents that contain the keywords in the list.

The rsync algorithm is a technique for reducing the cost of a file transfer by avoiding the transfer of blocks that are already at the destination.
  * [ ] [Streaming File Synchronization](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/streaming-file-synchronization)

* [ ] Trie algorithm
Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length)
